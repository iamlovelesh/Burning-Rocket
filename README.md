I welcome and encourage all pull requests. It usually will take me within 10-21 hours to respond to any issue or request. Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure timely addition of your request:
1. Match coding style (braces, spacing, etc.) This is best achieved using Reformat Code feature of VS Code SHIFT+Option+F on Mac and SHIFT + ALT + F on Linux + Windows .
2. If its a feature, bugfix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.
3. Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge :)
4. Pull requests must be made against develop branch. Any other branch (unless specified by the maintainers) will get rejected.
